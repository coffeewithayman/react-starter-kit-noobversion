Zero-Knowledge Encryption Options for User Sensitive Data

This document outlines different approaches for allowing users to store sensitive data 
in the application without the app owner being able to see or access it.

================================================================================

OPTION 1: CLIENT-SIDE ENCRYPTION WITH USER-CONTROLLED KEYS
================================================================================

How it works:
- User provides password/passphrase
- Data encrypted in browser using Web Crypto API
- Only encrypted data stored in your database
- Encryption key never leaves user's device

Pros:
- True zero-knowledge architecture
- You never see the encryption key or plain data
- Uses browser's built-in Web Crypto API (no external dependencies)
- Relatively simple to implement

Cons:
- If user forgets password, data is permanently lost
- No account recovery possible
- Each device needs the password to decrypt data

Use cases:
- Password managers
- Personal notes and journals
- Financial data storage
- Any highly sensitive personal information

Implementation approach:
- Use AES-GCM encryption with Web Crypto API
- Derive encryption key from user password using PBKDF2
- Store encrypted data as base64 strings in Convex database
- Decrypt data client-side when user provides password

================================================================================

OPTION 2: PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY (ASYMMETRIC)
================================================================================

How it works:
- User generates public/private key pair in browser
- Public key stored on server
- Private key stays on user's device
- Data encrypted with public key, decrypted with private key

Pros:
- Can share encrypted data between users
- Backup and recovery possibilities
- More flexible than symmetric encryption

Cons:
- More complex implementation
- Key management challenges
- Larger encrypted data size
- Performance overhead for large data

Use cases:
- Secure messaging between users
- Document sharing with encryption
- Multi-user collaborative sensitive data

Implementation approach:
- Use RSA or elliptic curve cryptography
- Generate key pairs with Web Crypto API
- Store public keys in database
- Implement secure private key storage/backup

================================================================================

OPTION 3: HARDWARE SECURITY KEYS (WEBAUTHN)
================================================================================

How it works:
- Use hardware tokens (YubiKey, TouchID, etc.) for encryption keys
- Keys stored in secure hardware, never extractable
- Authentication and encryption tied to physical device

Pros:
- Highest level of security
- Keys physically protected
- Resistant to software attacks
- Industry standard (FIDO2/WebAuthn)

Cons:
- Requires physical hardware
- Limited device compatibility
- More expensive for users
- Complex backup scenarios

Use cases:
- High-security enterprise applications
- Financial institutions
- Government/military applications
- Applications requiring regulatory compliance

Implementation approach:
- Use WebAuthn API for key generation and authentication
- Integrate with FIDO2 protocol
- Implement fallback authentication methods

================================================================================

OPTION 4: BROWSER-BASED SECURE ENCLAVE
================================================================================

How it works:
- Use browser's built-in secure storage mechanisms
- Web Crypto API for key generation and storage
- IndexedDB for encrypted data storage
- Keys tied to browser/origin

Pros:
- Good security model
- No external dependencies
- Built into modern browsers
- Fast performance

Cons:
- Limited to single browser/device
- Data loss if browser data is cleared
- No cross-device synchronization
- Browser compatibility considerations

Use cases:
- Local sensitive data storage
- Temporary secure data handling
- Single-device applications
- Offline-first sensitive applications

Implementation approach:
- Generate non-extractable keys with Web Crypto API
- Use IndexedDB for local encrypted storage
- Implement secure key derivation
- Handle browser storage limitations

================================================================================

OPTION 5: THIRD-PARTY ZERO-KNOWLEDGE SERVICES
================================================================================

How it works:
- Integrate with established zero-knowledge providers
- Examples: Bitwarden SDK, Ockam, Virgil Security
- Leverage battle-tested encryption implementations

Pros:
- Professional, audited implementations
- Proven security track record
- Often include additional features
- Regular security updates

Cons:
- External dependencies
- Potential vendor lock-in
- Additional costs
- Trust in third-party provider

Use cases:
- When you want proven solutions
- Enterprise applications
- Applications requiring compliance certifications
- Rapid development with security requirements

Implementation approach:
- Evaluate and integrate chosen provider's SDK
- Follow provider's best practices
- Implement proper key management
- Plan for vendor independence if needed

================================================================================

RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

For most applications, OPTION 1 (Client-Side Encryption with User-Controlled Keys) 
provides the best balance of:
- Security (true zero-knowledge)
- Implementation complexity (manageable)
- User experience (familiar password-based model)
- No external dependencies
- Full control over the implementation

This approach ensures that sensitive data is encrypted before it ever leaves the 
user's browser, making it impossible for the application owner to access the 
plain text data, even with full database access.

================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

Security Best Practices:
- Use strong key derivation (PBKDF2, Argon2, or scrypt)
- Implement proper salt generation
- Use authenticated encryption (AES-GCM)
- Secure key storage in memory
- Clear sensitive data from memory after use
- Implement secure random number generation

User Experience:
- Clear communication about password importance
- Password strength requirements
- Backup/export options for encrypted data
- Progressive enhancement for unsupported browsers
- Clear security model explanation to users

Technical Implementation:
- Use Web Crypto API for all cryptographic operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for encryption/decryption
- Consider performance impact on large datasets
- Plan for data migration if encryption scheme changes
